JavaScript SSAT

A fully functional JavaScript version of the Stop-Signal Anticipation Task (SSAT) (see Zandbelt and Vink, 2010). Task can be used to generate behavioral measurements of reactive and proactive inhibition. Subjects are presented with three parallel horizontal lines. On each trial, a bar moves at a constant speed from the lower line towards the upper line, reaching the middle line in 800 milliseconds. The main task is to stop the bar as close to the middle line as possible (i.e. Go trial). Stop trials are identical to Go trials, except that the bar stops moving automatically before reaching the middle line, indicating that a response has to be suppressed (i.e. stop-signal). The probability that such a stop-signal will appear is manipulated across trials and can be anticipated based on different cues.
